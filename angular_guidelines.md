We are going to create a angular 19 website.  Follow these guidelines for the new project:

1. Use Modular Architecture: Organize your application into smaller, manageable modules.
2. Implement Lazy Loading: Improve initial load time by loading features on demand.
3. Adopt Component-Based Architecture: Break your application into reusable, independent components.
4. Utilize Standalone Components: Take advantage of Angular 19's standalone components for simpler, more flexible code structure.
5. Apply Single Responsibility Principle: Ensure each component, service, and module has a single, well-defined purpose.
6. Implement State Management: Use a state management library for complex applications.
7. Use Reactive Forms: Leverage Angular's reactive forms for more robust form handling.
8. Follow Angular Style Guide: Adhere to official Angular coding style guidelines for consistency.
9. Optimize Performance: Implement Angular's built-in performance optimization techniques.
10. Implement Proper Error Handling: Create a centralized error handling mechanism.
11. Use TypeScript Features: Leverage TypeScript's strong typing and latest features.
12. Create Reusable Services: Develop services for shared business logic and data access.
13. Implement Proper Security Measures: Follow Angular's security best practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
14. Use Angular CLI: Utilize Angular CLI for consistent project structure and easier development.
15. Implement Proper Testing: Write unit tests and end-to-end tests for your components and services.
16. Use Zoneless change detection
17. Use Signal based forms
18. Use Material 3



Angular 19 best practices for isolating HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, as well as managing CSS with Material for implementing themes, include:

Component Structure and File Organization
Keep components small and focused, ideally not exceeding 400 lines of code per file1.

Place component files (TypeScript, HTML, and CSS) in the same folder1.

Use a consistent naming convention: component-name.component.ts, component-name.component.html, component-name.component.css1.

Style Encapsulation
Utilize Angular's default emulated view encapsulation to isolate component styles2.

Use the ::ng-deep selector sparingly when you need to override styles in child components5.

Consider using Custom Properties (CSS Variables) for more flexible theming options5.

CSS Management with Angular Material
Leverage Angular Material's theming system using Sass mixins for customizing components6.

Create custom themes by defining color palettes, typography, and component-specific styles6.

Use the @use '@angular/material' as mat; syntax to import Material's Sass modules6.

Implementing Themes
Use environment variables to manage different theme configurations1.

Implement a theme toggle functionality using Angular Material components like mat-slide-toggle3.

Apply themes dynamically by toggling CSS classes on the body element3.

Best Practices for CSS Architecture
Keep global styles in a separate file, typically styles.scss4.

Use component-specific styles for better encapsulation and maintainability4.

Utilize Angular Material's theming system to create consistent designs across your application6.

Use TypeScript features like interfaces and type checking for better code quality1.

Implement lazy loading for feature modules to improve initial load time1.

Use the trackBy function with ngFor for better performance when rendering lists1.
